##Drag & Drop Shortcodes

##Search & Filter
In Wordpress, you can search to find specific products, or filter product results to show only buy buttons, product pages, or product group embeds.

##Store Navigation
For a more complete store look, you can add View cart and Order Lookup links to your Wordpress site navigation. Optionally edit these links with text of your choice.

##Buy Button Embeds
Insert buy button shortcodes anywhere in your Wordpress pages or posts, to instantly add purchase, cart, and checkout to your existing Wordpress page designs.

##Product Embeds
A product embed will generate a fully designed, mobile friendly, beautiful product page. With zero setup time, you can insert shortcode - and be ready to start selling.

##Group Embeds
Combine your products into customized, embed ready, product groups. Product group shortcodes will generate a full featured, instant online store of those products!
